How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    	-It helped me see the difference within the two files by just showing me the revisions

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    	-It could make you a more efficient programmer by having the entire history of a file because 
	it could save you time when looking for differences

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    	-A pro is that you might not want to automatically save your work all the time because you are
	just seeing what works in your code. As when you leave google docs you can't go back to the 
	way that your file looked like before.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    	-I have no idea

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    	-you can see all of the revisions that have been made in a file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    	-By using version control you know that you can always go back to a previous version of a file
	without reprecussions

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    	-I want to use git for collaborating.
